++ Goals and structure of this document

This document defines the Defaults profile for RestMS.  The Defaults profile defines the behaviour of the default feed, join, and pipe types, providing a simple messaging model that implements a direct addressing ("Housecat") pattern.

We cover these aspects of the Defaults profile:

* What the profile is designed for
* What the resources look like and how they work
* Guidelines for client applications
* Guidelines for server implementers.

++ Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119[((bibcite rfc2119))].

++ Purpose and scope

- simplest functional messaging model
- implements 'channels' like IRC, RSS, AtomPub
- basis for other profiles

++ Syntax and semantics

- profile name
- explanation of resource documents
- semantics of message flow

- default profile
    - empty feed type (housecat)
    - empty join type (eq)
    - empty pipe type (fifo)

* The server SHOULD create a join from each new pipe to the default feed.

The default join implements a guaranteed Housecat pattern on every pipe.  If clients attempt to delete the default join, or create other joins onto the default feed, the server MUST respond with "403 Forbidden".

* The server SHOULD implement a default public feed called "default" of type "direct"..

++ Guidelines for clients

- checking presence of profile
- example client and server in pseudo-code

++ Guidelines for servers

- mandatory, every RestMS server MUST implement it.
- persistence options
- design suggestions
